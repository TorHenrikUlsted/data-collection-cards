Data Collection Cards
- A simple tool to create and print data collection cards
- Its purpose is to be used in education (i.e. statistics) to teach students about data collection and analysis or to learn about students preferences.

It provides a platfrom for students that have difficulties with:
- Dyslexia
- Reading and writing
- Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)
- Low motivation


# The Core Concept
The activity uses:

- Cards with pictures instead of text (addressing dyslexia)
- Colored dots for answers (visual categorization)
- Physical movement and interaction (addressing attention span)
- Creating tangible data representations students can see and touch


# How to use

1. Create a new collection of cards.
2. Add cards to the collection.
3. Print the cards.
4. Cut out the cards.
5. Play the game.


# How to play
## Data Collection:
1. One student shows their card to a classmate
2. The classmate points to the colored dot that represents their answer
3. The student puts a small sticker or makes a tally mark on that colored dot
4. Each card collects multiple responses (8-10 students' answers)

## Marking the Dots:
One Response = One Mark in the designated input field at the right side of the card

If 10 students answer your "Favorite Sport" question, you'll have 10 marks spread across the different colored dots
For example: 4 marks on blue (football), 3 on green (Tennis), 2 on red (Handball), 1 on yellow (E-sport)

## The Final Display:
- After collecting responses, students transfer their results to a large mat or chart (can be directly into excel):
- Each token represents one student's response
- This creates a physical bar graph

 - Can be put up as a frequency table, then summed up to get the total number of responses for each category.
 - And then used to calculate the mean, median, mode.
 - Can be used to draw graphs.
